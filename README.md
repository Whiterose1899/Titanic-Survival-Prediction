The files Titanic model contains the ML model which would predict the death of a person on board. 
Many factors effect this situtation. Based on the analysis I have used new features for the model for better prediction. 

I have used the train.csv file to train the model and it has been tested on train.csv file. 
You could find the results on titanic_submissions.csv file which would be containing the results of my test. 
Run it on your computer to check out the results.
